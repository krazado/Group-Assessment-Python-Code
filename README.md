Companion's Breweries must choose between acquiring Site A, a countryside family pub, or Site B, a disused inner-city church, to expand its pub network. A regression model, using data from 47 existing pubs, predicts revenue based on factors like Management Quality, Staff Quality, Interior Type, Regional Income, and Competition Density. Site A's projected revenue ranges from £7.12 to £10.64 million, while Site B's range is £2.02 to £5.55 million. Despite Site B's potential for premium pricing and long-term growth, Site A is recommended for its safer investment profile, established operation, and loyal staff. Further due diligence on Site A's repair costs and revenue potential is advised, while Site B may be suitable for a longer-term, ambitious project.
